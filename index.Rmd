#### Course Description {-}

This course is intended for those with little or no past training in
quantitative methods. The course is an intensive introduction to some of
the principles and methods of statistical analysis in social research.
Topics covered in MY464 include descriptive statistics, basic ideas of
inference and estimation, contingency tables and an introduction to
linear regression models. For those with some quantitative training the
slightly more advanced course MY452 (Applied Regression Analysis) would
be more appropriate, followed by other Department of Methodology and
Department of Statistics courses on quantitative methods, such as MY454
(Applied Statistical Computing), MY455 (Multivariate Analysis and
Measurement), MY456 (Survey Methodology), MY457 (Causal Inference for
Observational and Experimental Studies), MY459 (Quantitative Text
Analysis), ST416 (Multilevel Modelling), and ST442 (Longitudinal Data
Analysis).

#### Course Objectives {-}

This course aims to impart a level of familiarity suitable for a
moderately critical understanding of the statistical material in the
journals commonly used by students in their work and the ability to use
some elementary techniques.

\newpage

#### Teaching {-}

-   **Lectures**: Ten two-hour lectures in weeks 1 - 5 and 7 - 11:

-   **Computer classes**: Each student will attend a one-hour class each
    week, **starting after the Week 2 lecture**. Thus, classes meeting
    later in the week than the lecture will meet in Weeks 2-5 and 7-10, while
    classes meeting earlier in the week than the lecture will meet in Weeks 3-5
    and 7-11.  Please see on-line timetables for the
    times and places of the class groups. The allocation of students to
    classes is done through LSE for You. This will be explained in the
    first lecture and on the Moodle page. Please contact the course
    administrator listed on the Moodle page if you have any issues.

#### Course Materials {-}

-   **Coursepack**: This coursepack is the main course text.  It is available
    to be viewed online at https://lse-methodology.github.io/MY464/  You can
    view the coursepack in HTML form, or download it as a PDF or ePub to view
    offline.

-   **Lecture slides**: Copies of the slides displayed during
    the lectures can be downloaded from the MY464 Moodle page.

-   **Recommended course texts**:

    -   Alan Agresti and Christine Franklin (2013). *Statistics: The Art
        and Science of Learning from Data* (Third Ed.). Pearson.

    -   Alan Agresti and Barbara Finlay (2013). *Statistical Methods for
        the Social Sciences* (Fourth Ed.). Pearson

    Earlier/later editions are also suitable. While neither of these books is
    absolutely required, you may wish to purchase one if you would
    like to have additional explanation, examples and exercises to
    supplement the coursepack.  Of these two, Agresti and Finlay is a
    bit more advanced. It is also the recommended additional course text
    for MY452 (which also has a coursepack similar to this one), so you
    may want to purchase it if you are planning to also take
    that course.

-   **Other text books**: There are hundreds of introductory textbooks
    on statistics and quantitative methods, many of them covering almost
    identical material. If you have one which you would like to use, and
    which looks as if it covers the same material at about the same
    level as this course, then it is probably suitable as
    additional reading.

    -   There are also many books which focus on the SPSS statistical
        software package used in the computer classes. We do not
        consider them necessary for this course, or for learning
        statistics or SPSS. If, however, you feel otherwise, some such
        books are mentioned in the Appendix.

#### Homework {-}

There will be homework assignments associated with each computer class.
These are your opportunity
to practice interpreting the results of the types of analyses that are
introduced in the lectures and then carried out in the computer classes.
The homework questions are also broadly similar in style to typical
examination questions for MY464. The questions are based on results of
the computer class exercises or of further similar analyses. For the
homework, you can use output that you produced yourself in the class or
afterwards. Alternatively, all the computer outputs that are required to
answer the homework questions can be downloaded from the Moodle page.

Homework should be submitted by 5pm, two weekdays after your computer class (eg Monday for a Thursday class, Wednesday for a Monday class).
Please see the MY464
Moodle page for instructions on how to submit your homeworks. Homework
submitted in time will be corrected and returned at the next class.
Please make sure to clearly indicate your name, and the time, class
number and class teacher of your computer class on all homework
assignments. For the homework assignments, students are encouraged to
work together.

#### MY464 on Moodle {-}
<!-- {#sss-moodle} -->

The course materials are all available on Moodle. Go to
<http://moodle.lse.ac.uk/> and login using your *username* and
*password* (the same as for your LSE e-mail). Then in the *select
courses* dialogue box type in MY464, and in *search results* click on
MY464. The site contains the structure of the course week by week, the
readings, weekly computer class assignments and the associated data
sets, coursepack and other materials, as well as a section on news and
announcements.

#### Notes on studying for the course {-}

To learn the material from this course you must do the work every week
since it is cumulative; if you miss a week or two
there is a chance that you will struggle to catch up. Also bear in mind that
most people cannot learn quantitative techniques passively by just
turning up to the lectures and reading the occasional chapter in a
textbook. To learn statistics you have to do it; there are no shortcuts.
Thus in addition to a two-hour weekly lecture there will be one-hour
computer classes (in which you do some data analysis and interpretation
using SPSS - instructions will be provided) and there will be weekly
homework (which will be corrected but not graded by your class teacher).
Doing the assignments in the computer classes and the homework
is the best way to make sure you have understood and can apply what was covered
in the lectures. If you are having any trouble this will reveal what the
problem is. Thus the course is designed to have multiple, reinforcing
ways of helping you learn this material.

#### Examinations/assessment {-}

There will be a **two-hour examination in the Summer Term**. This
is an **open-book examination**, to which you are allowed to bring in
one A4 sheet of reference material.  This can be typed or handwritten, prepared yourself or in collaboration with others. You are required to bring your own calculators for the
examination. Examination papers from previous years are available for
revision purposes at the LSE library web site.  2018-19 is the first year that
MY464 has existed, but the past exams for MY451 provide a good guide to the kinds of
questions that we ask.  Exams vary from year to year.  Some questions closely follow
questions that you will have answered in the homeworks or have seen on past exam papers.
Other require you to apply the principles you have learned in new ways. Students should
understand that past examinations should only be used as rough guides to
the types of questions that are likely to appear on the examination.

#### Computing {-}

Students must know their Username and Password in time for the first
class. This information can be obtained from IT Help Desk (Library, 1st
floor). The course uses Microsoft Windows-based software. If you are not
familiar with the program, you might want to attend introductory courses
in Windows during the first two weeks of the term. The statistical
package being used is SPSS, which will be introduced in the first
computing class of the course.

#### Software availability {-}

A personal copy of the program SPSS can be bought by course
participants (maximum 1 copy per person) for the price of £10 from IT
services, see https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/imt/services/hardware-software/purchasing 

#### Feedback {-}

We would welcome any comments you have on the course. If there are any
problems that we can deal with, we will attempt to do so as quickly as
possible. Speak to any member of the course team, or to your
departmental supervisor if you feel that would be easier for you. Also
please let us know if you find any errors or omissions in the
coursepack, so that we can correct them.

#### FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions {-}

**Why do we use SPSS? I’ve heard that SAS/STATA/MINITAB/R/LIMDEP is much
better.** At this level it does not matter which program you use since
we are learning standard procedures that are common to all programs. In
favour of SPSS is that it has an easy to learn interface and that it is
widely available at sites both within and outside the UK.

**Can I get a copy of the SPSS software to use on my home computer?**
Yes, for a small fee from IT Services helpdesk, not from the Department
of Methodology.

**I’m taking MY464 because I want to learn how to use SPSS but we don’t
seem to learn very much about the program. Why is that?** MY464 is not a
course about learning to use SPSS. We use the program merely to
facilitate data analysis and interpretation. Some options for learning
more about SPSS will be mentioned in the first lecture.

**I’m taking MY464 to help me analyse data for my dissertation. Can I
discuss my data and my specific problems with the lecturers?** Yes, but
not during the course. Staff of the Department of Methodology will be
happy to talk to you about problems specific to your dissertation during
the weekly sessions of the Methodology Surgery (see the website of the
department for more information).

**Does the coursepack contain everything I need to know for the exam?**
Yes. However, you will stand by far the best chance in the exam if you
also attend the lectures, where the lecturers emphasise and explain the
key parts of the material.

**The lecturer introduced some material that was not in the coursepack.
Do I need to know that material?** This is almost certainly an illusion.
The lectures will not introduce any genuinely new material not included
in the course pack. However, sometimes the lecturer may of course use
different words or a different example to further explain some topic.
Copies of the most relevant notes displayed at the lectures will be
posted in the MY464 Moodle site. All of the material required for the
exam is contained in the coursepack, with the posted lecture notes as
additional clarification.

**Can I work together on the homework with my friends?** Yes, we
positively encourage you to discuss the homework assignments with your
colleagues. If you do this, please submit **one** copy to be marked
rather than multiple copies of the same answers.

**The class teachers are always very busy during class helping people
with problems and I can’t get enough personal attention. Why can’t there
be more class teachers in the classroom?** For MY464 there will usually
be two class teachers per classroom i.e. double the normal complement.
Even so we realise that you may not be able to get attention at the
exact moment you want it. Please be patient and if help is not
immediately available you can always try asking the person who is
sitting next to you!

**I’m not registered at the LSE but at another University of London
college. Can I attend this course?** Normally yes, but you will have to
complete an intercollegiate enrolment form.

**I would like to audit the course without taking the exam. Is that
OK?** Yes, you are welcome to attend the lectures providing you are an
LSE/University of London student and there is room for you.

**MY464 is not challenging enough for me. Is there a more difficult
course?** Yes, MY452 and numerous other courses offered by the
Department of Methodology and the Statistics department.
